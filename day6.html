            <p>The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is our best smartphone in the world right now: here's why. We think the S21
                Ultra is a fantastic choice for you with one of the best camera suites, phenomenal power, great battery
                life, a solid design and a whole host of other great features. The Galaxy S21 Ultra isn't a cheap
                handset with a pricetag that, despite being cheaper than its predecessor, is still costlier than any
                competing flagship, but if you're looking for the ultimate smartphone experience in 2021 you will be
                hard pressed to do better than this latest from Samsung.</p>

    <h2>iPhone 12 Pro Max</h2>

    <div class="product">
        <p>The iPhone 12 Pro takes everything great about the iPhone 12 and elevates it. Then there's the iPhone 12 Pro
            Max that offers better battery life and a slightly more powerful camera as well as a huge screen. The extra
            for the iPhone 12 Pro may not be worth the notable price hike up to $999 to everyone, but this phone pairing
            is undeniably the best Apple has released yet. The iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max are the most powerful
            iPhones to date, and they're also the company's priciest. While the same amount of money could buy you a
            Samsung phone with a bigger screen and more storage at the base level, most iOS users don't want to deal
            with Android. Instead, they can look forward to a few key upgrades over the iPhone 11 Pro, like 5G and
            MagSafe for clipping on accessories (as well as wireless chargers) easily and securely. </p>

    <h2>OnePlus 9 Pro</h2>

        <div class="product">
            <p>The OnePlus 9 Pro is a top-tier flagship and one that improves on the main weakness of previous OnePlus
                phones – their cameras. This is a phone that can compete with the other top handsets, and some may even
                prefer its camera to the other phones on this list. OnePlus may have focused its attention on the
                cameras for the OnePlus 9 Pro, but this is an overall incredible smartphone offering top-end power, a
                great display and most features you'd expect from any other phone you'll find on this list. Battery life
                isn't the absolute best, and it's remarkably expensive considering OnePlus' history in the smartphone
                market but it has earned its place this high on our best smartphone list because it's the overall
                package.</p>

        <div class="product">
            <p>The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is Samsung's most expensive non-foldable phone, and generation's big perk of the
                Note is that it comes with an amazing camera. Get ready for extreme close-ups with the 5x optical zoom
                and 50x digital zoom. The S Pen returns with new tricks like recording voice notes and syncing them with
                handwritten notes. This is one of Samsung's most powerful phones, but it's more expensive than most of
                the S21 series. You get it all with the Note 20 Ultra: a stylus, a camera with a 5x optical zoom and 50x
                digital zoom, a faster chipset (at least in the US version) and a 6.9-inch 120Hz screen. Not everyone
                needs an 'everything phone' like this, but if you want it all and don't want to wait for the Galaxy Z
                Fold 2, this is one of Samsung's best.</p>

    <h2>Google Pixel 5</h2>

        <div class="product">
            <p>The Google Pixel 5 came out in October, and it has some improvements on the Pixel 4 – but also fewer
                features. Yes, the Pixel 5 is a bit of a course correction as Google trims perks to lower the Pixel 5's
                price to make it as much of an 'affordable flagship' as the iPhone 12 mini and OnePlus 8T. But a few key
                improvements make it a superior phone to the Pixel 4 XL that it's replacing on this list. The Pixel 5 is
                powerful enough and its camera capability is still great, but some trimmed features make this phone a it
                less advanced than the competition. Google’s knack for photo optimization still makes this phone a good
                choice for photographers, but that's not enough to break into the top half of the order. Its very slim
                bezels make it a surprisingly small phone, though, and perfect for those who like to text one-handed.
